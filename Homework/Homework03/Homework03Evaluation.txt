Homework03 Evaluation
======================

Nice work on this assignment!
Here are a couple of observations and comments:

Although the book does this, it's generally not a good idea
to put long lines of dashes between blocks of code.  Use the
*proper* JavaDoc block comment instead and leave the dashes
out.  Like this:

/**
 * block description or funciton description
 * @param tag
 * @param tag
 * @param tag
 * @return tag
 * @throws tag
 */
