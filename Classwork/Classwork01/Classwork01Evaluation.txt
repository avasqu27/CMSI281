Classwork01 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

Also, your repository structure is incorrect.  Please take a
look at the Assignment Submissions section of the week 01 web
page and make your structure look like that one.

Also, try to make your indenting consistent throughout your code.

Also, the file name is wrong.  It should be SayHello.java, not
Classwork01 with no file extension.

You get 94% out of 100% on this.
