======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

You didn't change the method names to be more queue-like,
as was specified in the problem.  This is a queue, not a
stack, so you should use something like insert/remove or
enqueue/dequeue instead of push/pop.

Your test coverage is adequate, but you can always do more
testing -- consider testing for failure conditions as well
as successes, to make sure you're catching errors to let
the user know what happened and what to do about them.

scores:
